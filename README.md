🛡️ Arda Fidancı – SOC Engineer | Cybersecurity Enthusiast

Hello, I’m Arda Fidancı, a Software Engineering student at Ostim Teknik University, Ankara, pursuing a career in Cybersecurity — particularly in Security Operations and Threat Analysis.
My main focus is building a deep, hands-on understanding of network defense, intrusion detection, automation, and system monitoring using both enterprise-grade and open-source technologies.

🧠 Current Focus

Developing a fully functional home SOC lab for learning and experimentation.

Integrating Security Onion, Splunk, Zeek, and Suricata for log analysis, alert correlation, and packet inspection.

Using pfSense as a firewall and gateway with VLAN segmentation and VPN tunneling for realistic traffic scenarios.

Experimenting with threat hunting and incident response automation using Python scripts and n8n workflows.

Learning Linux internals, network packet analysis, and system hardening techniques.

🧰 Tools and Technologies
